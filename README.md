To ingest data into **Neo4j** and implement pagination in **Java** with **Maven**, we can use the **Neo4j Java Driver**. Here’s a guide to setting up a simple data ingestion and pagination system.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Maven Project
1. **Add the Neo4j Java Driver** dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

2. **Add any other dependencies** you may need, such as `slf4j` for logging, if required.

### Step 2: Connect to Neo4j

Create a connection to the Neo4j database using the Java driver.

### Step 3: Ingest Data into Neo4j

Define a method to ingest data into Neo4j. For simplicity, let’s create nodes with a label `Person` and properties `name` and `age`.

### Step 4: Implement Pagination in Neo4j

We can use `SKIP` and `LIMIT` in Cypher queries to paginate results.

### Step 5: Main Method to Test Data Ingestion and Pagination

Create a main class to test the data ingestion and pagination.

### Explanation

- **Data Ingestion**: We’re creating 100 `Person` nodes with properties `name` and `age`.
- **Pagination**:
  - The `paginate` method uses `SKIP` and `LIMIT` to fetch paginated results.
  - It calculates the number of records to skip based on the page number and page size.
  - Each page of data is returned as a list of maps, where each map represents a row of results.
- **Loop through pages**: The main class retrieves and prints each page until no data is returned.

### Running the Code

To run this code:

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Neo4jPaginationApp"
   ```

### Additional Notes
- **Page and pageSize** can be adjusted based on your data volume and requirements.
- For large datasets, consider adding **indexes** in Neo4j to improve query performance:
  ```cypher
  CREATE INDEX FOR (p:Person) ON (p.name);
  ```

This setup will ingest data, apply pagination, and print the results page-by-page in the console. Let me know if you encounter issues or need further customization!
